Welcome to Qanat's documentation!
======================================

Qanat is a command-line computational experiment's tracking system. It is designed to be used with any kind of computational experiment, given that they can be run by a script that accept command-line arguments. Qanat will handle the execution of those scripts and keep track of the arguments used and various others elements to facilitate reproducibility of computational workflows (especially in machine learning). It is useful when working on remote servers where there is often no GUI and there is a job-submission system like HTCondor or Slurm.

To learn how to use Qanat, please refer to the `Tutorials <tutorials/index.html>`_ page.
