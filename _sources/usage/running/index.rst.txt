Running an experiment
==============================

This page regroups small examples to showcase and explain how to use Qanat to run experiments.

.. note::
   We assume that you already have an experiment added to the database and are
   worried about running in different ways. To learn how to add experiments to the database, see the `Tutorials <../../tutorials/basics/index.html>`_. For all those experiments, we will use **experiment_name** as a placeholder for the experiment name.
